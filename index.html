    About Me</h1>
    <p>Greetings! I'm delighted to share my professional journey with you. With a diverse background in statistics, actuarial science, and analytics, I have acquired a wide range of skills and experiences that have shaped me into a versatile professional. Allow me to provide you with a glimpse into my career so far.
I began my academic journey at Sri Venkateswara College, University of Delhi, where I completed my Bachelor of Science Honors degree in Statistics from 2011 to 2014. During this time, I developed a strong foundation in statistical analysis and data interpretation, which served as a stepping stone for my future endeavors.
To further enhance my expertise, I undertook a significant challenge and successfully obtained eight actuarial certifications from the Institute & Faculty of Actuaries, UK. These certifications not only expanded my knowledge in the actuarial field but also showcased my commitment to professional growth and excellence.</p>
    <p> </p>  
    <p>From December 2014 to March 2016, I served as a Group Life Insurance Pricing Actuary at Birla Sunlife Insurance in India. This role allowed me to apply my actuarial knowledge to analyze risk and design pricing strategies for group life insurance policies. I thrived in this dynamic environment, gaining valuable insights into the insurance industry and honing my analytical skills.
In April 2016, I transitioned to ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, where I joined the Embedded Value team within the actuarial department. Collaborating with this team, I contributed to assessing the financial performance of the company's insurance policies and evaluating their long-term value. It was during this time that I solidified my understanding of embedded value calculations and further refined my actuarial expertise.
Seeking new challenges and opportunities, I joined Aon Retirement Services in September 2016. Within the UK Retirement Benefits division, I supported the Scheme Actuary in various actuarial tasks related to benefit plans. My responsibilities ranged from conducting actuarial valuations to analyzing retirement plans and advising clients on risk management strategies. This role allowed me to develop a holistic understanding of retirement benefit schemes and deepen my client management skills.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Driven by a passion for data-driven decision-making, I pursued a Master's degree in Informatics and Analytics from UNC Greensboro in 2019. Simultaneously, I worked as a Graduate Assistant in the university's IT department, specifically in Enterprise Analytics. Here, I played a pivotal role in creating performance monitoring dashboards, facilitating data-driven insights for various departments and contributing to strategic decision-making.
Continuing my journey, I joined Volvo Financial Services in July 2021. As a valued team member, I leveraged my analytical skills to design and develop sales and operations dashboards. These dashboards provided crucial insights, enabling the organization to make informed business decisions and drive operational efficiency.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Building upon my experiences, I embarked on an enriching internship at Apex Analytics from July 2022 to September 2022. During this period, I supported new and existing clients as a Software Implementation Intern, utilizing the firststrike commercial software of Apex Analytics. By collaborating closely with clients and addressing their needs, I gained invaluable experience in software implementation and client relationship management.
Recently, from November 2022 to April 2023, I had the privilege of working with Exelixis, where I played a pivotal role in supporting their Pharmacovigilance activities. I actively monitored ongoing clinical trials, ensuring vigilant and proactive identification of adverse events. Additionally, I was responsible for creating regulatory reports, such as Public Safety User Reports (PSUR) and Drug Safety User Reports (DSUR), ensuring compliance with stringent regulatory standards.</p>
    <p> </p> 
    <p>Throughout my career, I have strived to combine my technical expertise in statistics, actuarial science, and analytics with a passion for problem-solving and continuous improvement. I possess a strong aptitude for data analysis, deriving meaningful insights, and presenting complex information in a clear and concise manner. Additionally, my experience in software implementation and client relationship management has further refined my ability to work collaboratively and deliver exceptional results.
As I continue to explore new opportunities, I am eager to apply my skills, knowledge, and diverse background to make a valuable contribution to your organization. I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals and organizations that embrace innovation, analytical thinking, and a commitment to excellence.
Thank you for taking the time to learn about my journey. I invite you to explore my portfolio and discover more about my projects, skills, and achievements. Together, let's navigate the exciting world of data and analytics and unlock its transformative power.</p>
